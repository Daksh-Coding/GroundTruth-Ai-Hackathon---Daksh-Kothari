A bright, eye-catching advertisement featuring the official Maggi logo prominently at the top. Below the logo, showcase a vivid, high-quality image of Maggi 2-Minute Instant Noodles – Masala Flavor served hot in a bowl. The noodles should appear golden-yellow, soft, and well-coated with the signature masala seasoning. Add attractive garnishing such as cherry tomatoes, coriander leaves, green chilies, sweet corn, capsicum, or olives—keeping the visuals appetizing and vibrant.

Use a cheerful yellow background inspired by Maggi’s classic branding. Include text elements such as “Your Favourite Masala Taste,” “Made with Quality Spices,” and “Ready in Just 2 Minutes.” The overall design should feel friendly, homely, and youthful, conveying comfort food, quick preparation, and trusted taste. Maintain Maggi’s brand colors: bright yellow and warm red. The ad should evoke warmth, joy, and nostalgia, showing Maggi as the perfect snack for students, families, and busy individuals.

Ensure the product packet (Maggi Masala yellow pack) and the bowl of prepared noodles are both visible in the composition. The visual tone should be energetic, modern, and clean—perfect for digital marketing banners, posters, and social-media creatives.
